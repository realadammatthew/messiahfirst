# Statement of Faith

## The Scriptures

We believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of G-d. It is our final authority for faith and practice.

## The G-dhead

We believe in one G-d, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is fully G-d, yet there is one G-d.

## Yeshua the Jewish Messiah (Jesus Christ)

We believe that **Yeshua (Jesus) is the Jewish Messiah**, the Son of G-d, who:
- Was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary
- Lived a sinless life
- Died on the cross as the atoning sacrifice for the sins of mankind
- Rose bodily from the dead on the third day
- Ascended to heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father
- Will return to establish His kingdom on earth

## Salvation

We believe that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. It is a gift from G-d, not earned by works, and is available to all who repent of their sins and trust in Yeshua (Jesus) as L-rd and Savior.

## The Church

We believe in the universal Church, composed of all born-again believers in Yeshua (Jesus) the Jewish Messiah. The Church is called to proclaim the Good News, make disciples, and demonstrate G-d's love to the world.

## Israel and the Jewish People

We believe that G-d's covenant with Israel is eternal and irrevocable. We affirm:
- G-d's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob remain in effect
- Israel has a divine right to the land promised by G-d
- The Jewish people remain G-d's chosen people
- Messianics (Christians) should support and pray for Israel
- The Church has not replaced Israel in G-d's plan

## The Second Coming

We believe in the personal, visible, and glorious return of  (Jesus) the Jewish Messiah to establish His millennial kingdom on earth.

## Biblical Authority in Governance

We believe that biblical principles should guide personal conduct and, where possible, inform public policy. While we respect the separation of church and state, we believe that:
- Moral law reflects G-d's character and design
- Government has a divine mandate to promote justice and righteousness
- Citizens should vote and advocate according to biblical convictions
- Religious freedom is essential for a flourishing society

## Marriage and Family

We believe that marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman, as designed by G-d from creation. We affirm:
- The biblical model of marriage and family
- The importance of raising children in the fear and admonition of the L-rd
- The value and dignity of all human life from conception to natural death

This statement of faith guides our political engagement and policy positions as we seek to honor G-d in all aspects of American civic life.
