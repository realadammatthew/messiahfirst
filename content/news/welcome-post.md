# Welcome to Messiah First for America PAC

We are excited to launch Messiah First for America PAC, a Super PAC dedicated to proclaiming the Name of Yeshua (Jesus) the Jewish Messiah in American politics and supporting candidates who will advance His kingdom principles in governance.

## Why Now?

America stands at a crossroads. The foundational Judeo-Christian principles that built this great nation are under attack from multiple fronts. We believe it's time for believers to stand up boldly and declare that **Yeshua (Jesus) is L-rd** over every aspect of life, including our political system.

## Our Three-Fold Mission

### 1. Proclaim Yeshua (Jesus) the Jewish Messiah
We will not be ashamed of the Good News or hide our faith in the public square. Every action we take will boldly proclaim that Yeshua (Jesus) is the Jewish Messiah, the Son of the Living G-d, and the rightful King over all nations.

### 2. Educate on Messianic (Christian) Policy
We will provide clear, biblical guidance on the policy issues facing our nation. From the sanctity of life to support for Israel, from religious liberty to biblical marriage, we will help believers understand how their faith should inform their political engagement.

### 3. Support Aligned Candidates
We will identify, endorse, and financially support political candidates who share our biblical convictions and demonstrate the character and courage to govern according to G-d's principles.

## What Makes Us Different

Unlike other political organizations, we are explicitly **Messiah-centered**. While we welcome support from all who share our values, our foundation is uncompromisingly built on faith in Yeshua (Jesus) as L-rd and Savior.

We believe that:
- Government is ordained by G-d and should operate according to His principles
- America's prosperity has been directly tied to its acknowledgment of G-d
- The Church has a responsibility to be salt and light in the political realm
- Supporting Israel is both a biblical mandate and wise policy
- Religious freedom is the foundation of all other freedoms

## Getting Involved

We invite you to join this crucial mission by:

1. **Staying Informed**: Subscribe to our updates and follow our policy analysis
2. **Praying**: Commit to regular prayer for our nation, leaders, and mission
3. **Supporting**: Consider making a donation to support our endorsed candidates
4. **Sharing**: Help spread the word about our mission to other believers
5. **Voting**: Participate in every election and vote according to biblical principles

## Looking Ahead

In the coming months, you can expect:
- Detailed policy position papers on key issues
- Candidate profiles and endorsement announcements
- Educational resources for biblical political engagement
- Updates on legislative battles affecting religious freedom
- Opportunities for grassroots involvement

## A Call to Boldness

We live in times that demand bold faith and courageous action. The forces opposing biblical values in our culture are aggressive and well-funded. But we serve the G-d who raises up kings and brings them down, who holds the hearts of rulers in His hand.

As we launch this PAC, we do so with humility, knowing that our ultimate hope is not in politics but in the Kingdom of G-d. Yet we also recognize that G-d calls His people to be engaged citizens, working for justice and righteousness in every sphere of society.

Join us as we stand boldly for Yeshua (Jesus), educate our fellow believers, and support leaders who will honor G-d in American governance.

**"Blessed is the nation whose G-d is the L-rd, the people he chose for his inheritance."** - Psalm 33:12
