# Our Mission Statement

## Proclaiming the Name of Yeshua the Messiah

At Messiah First for America PAC, we believe that **Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah** and that His Name should be proclaimed boldly throughout America. We stand on the foundation that this nation was established on Judeo-Christian principles, and we seek to restore and maintain those biblical foundations in our political discourse and governance.

## Educating on Messianic and Christian Policy

We are committed to educating the American public on policies that align with Messianic (Christian) values, including:

- **Sanctity of Life**: Protecting the unborn and supporting policies that value all human life from conception to natural death
- **Biblical Marriage and Family**: Supporting the biblical definition of marriage between one man and one woman, and strengthening family structures
- **Religious Liberty**: Defending the constitutional right to freely practice faith and live according to biblical convictions
- **Israel Support**: Standing with Israel as God's chosen people and supporting America's alliance with the Jewish state
- **Biblical Justice**: Promoting justice systems that reflect biblical principles of mercy, truth, and righteousness

## Supporting Aligned Political Leaders

We identify, endorse, and financially support political candidates who:

- Acknowledge Yeshua as Lord and Savior
- Demonstrate a commitment to governing according to biblical principles
- Support policies that advance the Kingdom of God in America
- Stand boldly for religious freedom and traditional values
- Maintain unwavering support for Israel

## Our Vision for America

We envision an America where:

- The Name of Yeshua is honored in public discourse
- Biblical values guide policy decisions
- Religious freedom is protected and celebrated
- The next generation is raised with strong moral foundations
- America stands as a beacon of righteousness among the nations

## Call to Action

Join us in this vital mission to restore America's biblical foundation. Together, we can ensure that future generations inherit a nation that honors God and upholds His righteousness.
