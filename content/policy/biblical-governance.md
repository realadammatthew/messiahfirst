# Biblical Principles for Governance

## Foundation: Government as G-d's Institution

We believe that government is ordained by G-d for the purpose of promoting good and restraining evil (Romans 13:1-7). This divine mandate gives government both authority and responsibility to operate according to biblical principles.

- Promote limited government and individual responsibility

## Implementation Strategy

### Education and Advocacy
- Educate voters on biblical principles of governance

- Train believers to engage effectively in the political process

### Candidate Support
- Identify and support candidates who share these biblical convictions
- Provide independent expenditure support for aligned candidates
- Hold elected officials accountable to biblical principles

### Grassroots Mobilization
- Build networks of believers committed to biblical governance
- Organize prayer and fasting for our nation's leaders

## The Ultimate Goal

Our goal is not to establish a theocracy, but to see biblical principles influence public policy for the flourishing of all Americans. We believe that when government operates according to G-d's design, all people benefit from the resulting justice, peace, and prosperity.

As we engage in the political process, we do so with humility, recognizing that our ultimate hope is not in government but in the Kingdom of G-d. Yet we also recognize our responsibility as citizens to be salt and light in our nation's civic life.
